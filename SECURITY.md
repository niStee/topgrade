## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by creating a security advisory on GitHub or by emailing the
maintainers. We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a detailed response within 5 business days
indicating the next steps.

- Create a private advisory: <https://github.com/topgrade-rs/topgrade/security/advisories/new>
- Alternatively, open an issue and mark it clearly as security-related if a private advisory isn't possible.
