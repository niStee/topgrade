# What does this PR do?

## Standards checklist

- [ ] The PR title is descriptive and scoped (e.g., area: short summary)
- [ ] I have read `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] Optional: I have tested the code myself
- [ ] If this PR introduces user-facing messages, they are translated

## For new steps

- [ ] Optional: Topgrade skips this step where needed
- [ ] Optional: The `--dry-run` option works with this step
- [ ] Optional: The `--yes` option works with this step if it is supported by the underlying command

If you developed a feature or a bug fix for someone else and you do not have the means to test it, please tag this
person here.
